# Rival Rockets Angular 2 Frontend

To be paired with the Flask-RESTFul API backend, `rivalrockets-api`.

During development, insure that the dev API is running and available at <http://localhost:5000>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Heroku deployment

The `npm start` command is extended to perform a build then serve the application using Express on Heroku (based on <https://medium.com/@ryanchenkie_40935/angular-cli-deployment-host-your-angular-2-app-on-heroku-3f266f13f352> and <https://angular-cli-heroku.herokuapp.com/>).
